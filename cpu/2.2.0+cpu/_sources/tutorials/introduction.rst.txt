Introduction
============

Intel® Extension for PyTorch* extends PyTorch* with the latest performance optimizations for Intel hardware. 
Optimizations take advantage of Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) on Intel CPUs.

.. note::

  The package name used when you import Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* changed
  from ``intel_pytorch_extension`` (for versions 1.2.0 through 1.9.0) to
  ``intel_extension_for_pytorch`` (for versions 1.10.0 and later). Use the
  correct package name depending on the version you are using.

For the detailed list of supported features and usage instructions, refer to `Features <features.html>`_. For overview of Large Language Models (LLM) optimizations and usage instructions, refer to 
the `Large Language Models (LLM) <llm.html>`_ section.
