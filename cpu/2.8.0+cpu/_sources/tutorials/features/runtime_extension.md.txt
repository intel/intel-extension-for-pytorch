Runtime Extension
=================

Intel速 Extension for PyTorch\* Runtime Extension provides a couple of PyTorch frontend APIs for users to get finer-grained control of the thread runtime. It provides:

1. Multi-stream inference via the Python frontend module `ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModule`.
2. Spawn asynchronous tasks via the Python frontend module `ipex.cpu.runtime.Task`.
3. Program core bindings for OpenMP threads via the Python frontend `ipex.cpu.runtime.pin`.

**note**: Intel速 Extension for PyTorch\* Runtime extension is in the **prototype** stage. The API is subject to change. More detailed descriptions are available at [API Documentation page](../api_doc.rst).

## Requirements

Intel速 Extension for PyTorch\* Runtime Extension relies on `intel omp` to bind threads to cores. If you want to use it in your application, start model script with an extra flag: `LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:$PATH/libiomp5.so python model_script.py`.

## Use Cases

### Example of MultiStream Module

Runtime extension supports weight-sharing multi-stream inference for throughput mode on CPU. You need to convert the original model into multi-stream model and run the new multi-stream model as normal. The detailed description of parameters to create `MultiStreamModule` is available at [API Documentation page](../api_doc.rst).

`MultiStreamModule` can improve performance for inference in throughput mode. We suggest creating `MultiStreamModule` with `num_streams` of "AUTO", which heuristically decides the number of streams. Usually, it provides a reasonable performance. However, it may not be optimal for some cases (refer to the section [Performance recipes](#performance-recipes) for details). Manual tuning for number of streams is needed.

The `MultiStreamModule` creates number of streams based on input parameter `num_streams` and bind cores to stream based on input parameter `cpu_pool`. If the number of cores inside `cpu_pool` is divisible by `num_streams`, the cores will be allocated equally to each stream. If the number of cores inside `cpu_pool` is not divisible by `num_streams` with remainder N, one extra core will be allocated to the first N streams. We suggest to set the `num_streams` as divisor of core number inside `cpu_pool`.

If the inputs' batchsize is larger than and divisible by ``num_streams``, the batchsize will be allocated equally to each stream. If batchsize is not divisible by ``num_streams`` with remainder N, one extra piece will be allocated to the first N streams. If the inputs' batchsize is less than ``num_streams``, only the first batchsize's streams are used with mini batch as one. We suggest to set inputs' batchsize larger than and divisible by ``num_streams``. When creating `MultiStreamModule`, if you leave num of streams as "AUTO", we suggest to set inputs' batchsize larger than and divisible by number of cores.

Let's create some ExampleNets that will be used by further examples:
```
import torch
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex

class ExampleNet1(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ExampleNet1, self).__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 128, (3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        x1 = self.conv(x)
        y = torch.flatten(x1, start_dim=1)
        return y

class ExampleNet2(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ExampleNet2, self).__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 128, (3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
        self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 128, (3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)

    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        y1 = self.conv(x1)
        y2 = self.conv2(x2)
        y = torch.flatten(y1, start_dim=1)
        return y1, y

model1 = ExampleNet1()
model1.eval()
x = torch.rand(16, 64, 3, 3)

with torch.no_grad():
    traced_model1 = torch.jit.trace(model1, x)
    traced_model1 = torch.jit.freeze(traced_model1)

model2 = ExampleNet2()
model2.eval()
x2 = torch.rand(16, 64, 3, 3)

with torch.no_grad():
    traced_model2 = torch.jit.trace(model2, (x, x2))
    traced_model2 = torch.jit.freeze(traced_model2)
```

#### Examples1: Basic Usage
Here is the example of a model with single tensor input/output. We create a CPUPool with all the cores available on numa node 0. And creating a `MultiStreamModule` with stream number of 2 to do inference.
```
# Convert the model into multi_Stream_model
cpu_pool = ipex.cpu.runtime.CPUPool(node_id=0)
multi_Stream_model = ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModule(traced_model1, num_streams=2, cpu_pool=cpu_pool)

with torch.no_grad():
    y = multi_Stream_model(x)
```

#### Examples2: Usage with "AUTO" setting
When creating a `MultiStreamModule`, we have default settings for `num_streams` ("AUTO") and `cpu_pool` (with all the cores available on numa node 0). For the `num_streams` of "AUTO", there are limitations to use with int8 datatype as we mentioned in below performance receipts section.
```
# Convert the model into multi_Stream_model
multi_Stream_model = ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModule(traced_model1)

with torch.no_grad():
    y = multi_Stream_model(x)
```

#### Examples3: Usage for models with structure inputs/outputs
For module such as ExampleNet2 with structure input/output tensors, user needs to create `MultiStreamModuleHint` as input hint and output hint. `MultiStreamModuleHint` tells `MultiStreamModule` how to auto split the input into streams and concat the output from each steam.
```
# Convert the model into multi_Stream_model
cpu_pool = ipex.cpu.runtime.CPUPool(node_id=0)
# Create the input hint object
input_hint = ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModuleHint(0, 0)
# Create the output hint object
# When Python module has multi output tensors, it will be auto pack into a tuple, So we pass a tuple(0, 0) to create the output_hint
output_hint = ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModuleHint((0, 0))
multi_Stream_model = ipex.cpu.runtime.MultiStreamModule(traced_model2,
                                                        num_streams=2,
                                                        cpu_pool=cpu_pool,
                                                        input_split_hint=input_hint,
                                                        output_concat_hint=output_hint)

with torch.no_grad():
    y = multi_Stream_model(x, x2)
```

#### Performance recipes
There are two motivations to use the `MultiStreamModule`:
1. Better cache locality: With `MultiStreamModule`, the activations will be limited in the CPU cores allocated to this stream instead of the whole cpu_pool.
2. Reduce the OMP sync overhead: if one CPU core allocated to one stream, the whole execution needs to do OMP sync once after all streams finish execution instead of sync per layer.

Thus, `MultiStreamModule` may benefit performance for inference in throughput mode. However, the end-to-end performance is impacted by these issues:
1. The kernels' efficiency, which are different under different OMP threads' number.
2. The overhead of inputs' auto split and outputs' auto concat for each stream.
3. The overhead of pthread (stream async execution) wakes up and threads' synchronization after stream execution.

Here are some performance receipes that we recommend for better multi-stream performance.

* When creating `MultiStreamModule` with `torch.nn.Module` as imperative path module, each stream inside `MultiStreamModule` suffers the GIL issue when doing inference together. This hurts end-to-end performance. We recommend creating `MultiStreamModule` with the `torch.jit.ScriptModule`.

* For convolution network, `intel_extension_for_pytorch` has the quick path getting convolution primitive to mitigate overhead when `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is the same between the `torch.jit.trace` and model execution phases. To use this quick path for better performance, we recommend setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment before launching the model script. The recommended value of `OMP_NUM_THREADS` should equal the threads number used by each stream. For example, creating `MultiStreamModule` as stream number `s1` and CPUPool with core number `c1`, each stream will allocate threads number as `c1/s1`. We recommend setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS` as this value.

* `Numactl` and the threads management in `MultiStreamModule` work at different levels. `MultiStreamModule` has the thread affinity setting for each stream, which works in the thread level. However, for the Python modules outside the stream, such as the dataloader, are out of view for `MultiStreamModule`. As the result, we recommend using `numactl -C core_ids -m node_id` for the process level core and memory resource management. For the core resource setting by `numactl`, set it the same or superset of the core resource to create `CPUPool`. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined in current implementation.

#### Known issues
* Intel速 Extension for PyTorch\* runtime extension feature with Int8 data type does not support dynamic shape well. To avoid performance issues, we recommend setting the batchsize to do `jit.trace` with same mini batchsize used by each stream. For example, creating `MultiStreamModule` as stream number of `s1` and input global batchsize as `gb`, each stream will inference with mini-batchsize of `gb/s1`. We should use this mini-batchsize value to do `jit.trace`. To be aware of the `num_streams` value, we recommend creating `MultiStreamModule` with `num_streams` setting explicitly instead of "AUTO". Due to the same limitation, the behavior that each stream inference with different mini batchsize of int8 data type is undefined and not supported.

### Example of asynchronous task

Here is an example for using asynchronous tasks. With the support of a runtime API, you can run 2 modules simultaneously. Each module runs on the corresponding cpu pool.

```
cpu_pool1 = ipex.cpu.runtime.CPUPool([0, 1, 2, 3])
cpu_pool2 = ipex.cpu.runtime.CPUPool([4, 5, 6, 7])

task1 = ipex.cpu.runtime.Task(traced_model1, cpu_pool1)
task2 = ipex.cpu.runtime.Task(traced_model1, cpu_pool2)

y1_future = task1(x)
y2_future = task2(x)

y1 = y1_future.get()
y2 = y2_future.get()
```

### Example of configuring core binding

Runtime Extension provides API of `ipex.cpu.runtime.pin` to a CPU Pool for binding physical cores. We can use it without the async task feature. Here is the example to use `ipex.cpu.runtime.pin` in the `with` context.

```
cpu_pool = ipex.cpu.runtime.CPUPool(node_id=0)
with ipex.cpu.runtime.pin(cpu_pool):
    y_runtime = traced_model1(x)
```

## Detail Design

### How the core binding is implemented

The Runtime Extension relies on the `kmp_*` API inside `iomp` share library to fulfill the core binding. During the initialization of async threads, `kmp_*` API functions are invoked internally to start up an OpenMP group with specified number of worker threads. Each worker thread is then bound to the designated physical core(s) inside this OpenMP group. After initialization, when you submit a task, the OpenMP group will serve the requested task.

### Design of Task

Task is an abstraction of computation based on PyTorch module and is scheduled asynchronously. When a task is created with specific `nn.Module` or `jit module`, a sub-thread is initialized and bound to this task. During the initialization, an OpenMP worker group is created and bound to this sub-thread. After initialization, the sub-thread waits for input. When the main thread submits an input to this task, the sub-thread will wake up and execute the input. The main thread returns a `FutureTensor` and is not block until an explicit `FutureTensor.get()` is invoked to get the results executed in the sub-thread.

### IOMP preload or load during the runtime

Since Runtime Extension relies on the APIs from IOMP, we need to preload IOMP before executing the application. We want Intel速 Extension for PyTorch\* built with Runtime API enabled. This means it should work fine without loading IOMP if the user didn't use the runtime API. Here we choose to `dlopen` IOMP library during runtime and we ensure the IOMP symbols are initialized once globally.
