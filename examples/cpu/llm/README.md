# 1. LLM Optimization Overview

`ipex.llm` provides dedicated optimization for running Large Language Models (LLM) faster, including technical points like paged attention, ROPE fusion, etc.
And a set of data types are supported for various scenarios, including FP32, BF16, Weight Only Quantization INT8/INT4 (prototype).

# 2. Environment Setup

**Note**: The instructions in this section will setup an environment with a recent PyTorch\* nightly build and **a latest source build of IPEX**. 
If you would like to use stable PyTorch\* and IPEX release versions, please refer to the instructions [in the release branch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/blob/v2.7.0%2Bcpu/examples/cpu/llm/README.md#2-environment-setup),
in which IPEX is installed via prebuilt wheels using `pip install` rather than source code building.

## 2.1 [Recommended] Docker-based environment setup with compilation from source

```bash
# Get the Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* source code
git clone https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch.git
cd intel-extension-for-pytorch
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build an image with the provided Dockerfile by compiling Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* from source
# To have a custom ssh server port for multi-nodes run, please add --build-arg PORT_SSH=<CUSTOM_PORT> ex: 2345, otherwise use the default 22 SSH port
docker build -f examples/cpu/llm/Dockerfile --build-arg COMPILE=ON --build-arg PORT_SSH=2345 -t ipex-llm:main .

# Run the container with command below
docker run --rm -it --net host --privileged -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm ipex-llm:main bash

# When the command prompt shows inside the docker container, enter llm examples directory
cd llm

# Activate environment variables
# set bash script argument to "inference" or "fine-tuning" for different usages
source ./tools/env_activate.sh [inference|fine-tuning]
```

## 2.2 Conda-based environment setup with compilation from source

```bash
# Get the Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* source code
git clone https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch.git
cd intel-extension-for-pytorch
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive

# GCC 12.3 is required. Installation can be taken care of by the environment configuration script.
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n llm python=3.10 -y
conda activate llm

# Setup the environment with the provided script
cd examples/cpu/llm
bash ./tools/env_setup.sh 11

# Activate environment variables
# set bash script argument to "inference" or "fine-tuning" for different usages
source ./tools/env_activate.sh [inference|fine-tuning]
```

## 2.3 [Optional] Setup for Running Jupyter Notebooks

After setting up your docker or conda environment, you may follow these additional steps to setup and run Jupyter Notebooks. The port number can be changed.

### 2.3.1 Jupyter Notebooks for Docker-based Environments

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install notebook matplotlib

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --allow-root
```

1. Open up a web browser with the given URL and token.
2. Open the notebook.
3. Run all cells. 

### 2.3.2 Jupyter Notebooks for Conda-based Environments

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install notebook ipykernel matplotlib

# Register ipykernel with Conda
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=IPEX-LLM

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --allow-root
```

1. Open up a web browser with the given URL and token.
2. Open the notebook.
3. Change your Jupyter Notebook kernel to IPEX-LLM.
4. Run all cells. 

<br>

*Note*: In `env_setup.sh` script a `prompt.json` file is downloaded, which provides prompt samples with pre-defined input token lengths for benchmarking.
For **Llama-3 models** benchmarking, the users need to download a specific `prompt.json` file, overwriting the original one.

```bash
wget -O prompt.json https://intel-extension-for-pytorch.s3.amazonaws.com/miscellaneous/llm/prompt-3.json
```

The original `prompt.json` file can be restored from the repository if needed.

```bash
wget https://intel-extension-for-pytorch.s3.amazonaws.com/miscellaneous/llm/prompt.json
```

# 3. How To Run LLM with ipex.llm

Inference and fine-tuning are supported in individual directories.

For inference example scripts, visit the [inference](./inference/) directory.

For fine-tuning example scripts, visit the [fine-tuning](./fine-tuning/) directory.
