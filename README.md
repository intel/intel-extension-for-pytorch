# Intel® Extension for PyTorch\*

Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* extends PyTorch\* with up-to-date features optimizations for an extra performance boost on Intel hardware. Optimizations take advantage of Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) on Intel CPUs as well as Intel X<sup>e</sup> Matrix Extensions (XMX) AI engines on Intel discrete GPUs. Moreover, Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* provides easy GPU acceleration for Intel discrete GPUs through the PyTorch\* xpu device.

Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* provides optimizations both for eager and graph modes. However,  compared to the eager mode, the graph mode in PyTorch\* normally yields better performance from the optimization techniques like operation fusion. Intel® Entension for PyTorch\* amplifies them with more comprehensive graph optimizations. Both PyTorch `Torchscript` and `TorchDynamo` graph modes are supported. With `Torchscript`, we recommend using `torch.jit.trace()` as your preferred option, as it generally supports a wider range of workloads compared to `torch.jit.script()`.

The extension can be loaded as a Python module for Python programs or linked as a C++ library for C++ programs. In Python scripts, you can enable it dynamically by importing `intel_extension_for_pytorch`.

## Large Language Models (LLMs) Optimization

In the current technological landscape, Generative AI (GenAI) workloads and models have gained widespread attention and popularity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the dominant models driving these GenAI applications. Starting from 2.1.0, specific optimizations for certain LLM models are introduced in the Intel® Extension for PyTorch\*. Check [LLM optimizations](./examples/cpu/inference/python/llm) for details.

## Installation

### CPU version

Use one of the following commands to install the CPU version of Intel® Extension for PyTorch\*.
