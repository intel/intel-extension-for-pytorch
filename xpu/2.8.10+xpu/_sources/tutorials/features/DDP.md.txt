DistributedDataParallel (DDP)
=============================

## Introduction

`DistributedDataParallel (DDP)` is a PyTorch\* module that implements multi-process data parallelism across multiple GPUs and machines. With DDP, the model is replicated on every process, and each model replica is fed a different set of input data samples. Please refer to [DDP Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) for an introduction to DDP.

The PyTorch `Collective Communication (c10d)` library supports communication across processes. To run DDP on GPU, we use Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\* (formerly known as torch-ccl) to implement the PyTorch c10d ProcessGroup API (https://github.com/intel/torch-ccl). It holds PyTorch bindings maintained by Intel for the Intel® oneAPI Collective Communications Library\* (oneCCL), a library for efficient distributed deep learning training implementing such collectives as `allreduce`, `allgather`, and `alltoall`. Refer to [oneCCL Github page](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneCCL) for more information about oneCCL.

## Installation of Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\*

To use PyTorch DDP on GPU, install Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\* as described below.

### Install PyTorch and Intel® Extension for PyTorch\*

Make sure you have installed PyTorch and Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* successfully.
For more detailed information, check [Installation Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?platform=gpu).

### Install Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\*

#### [Recommended] Install from prebuilt wheels


* Install `oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch`

```
# Generic Python* for CPU
REPO_URL: https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/cpu/us/
# Generic Python* for GPU
REPO_URL: https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
```

Installation from either repository shares the command below. Replace the place holder `<REPO_URL>` with a real URL mentioned above.

```bash
python -m pip install oneccl_bind_pt --extra-index-url <REPO_URL>
```


#### Install from source

Refer to [Installation Guide](https://github.com/intel/torch-ccl/tree/ccl_torch2.1.300+xpu?tab=readme-ov-file#install-from-source) to install Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\* from source.

### Runtime Dynamic Linking


- dynamic link oneCCl from oneAPI basekit:

```bash
source <ONEAPI_ROOT>/ccl/latest/env/vars.sh
source <ONEAPI_ROOT>/mpi/latest/env/vars.sh
```

Note: Make sure you have installed [basekit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#base-kit) when using Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\* on Intel® GPUs. If the basekit is installed with a package manager, <ONEAPI_ROOT> is `/opt/intel/oneapi`.


## DDP Usage

DDP follows its usage in PyTorch. To use DDP with Intel® Extension for PyTorch\*, make the following modifications to your model script:

* Import the necessary packages.
```python
import torch
import intel_extension_for_pytorch 
import oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch
```      
* Initialize the process group with ccl backend.
```python
dist.init_process_group(backend='ccl')
```        
* For DDP with each process exclusively works on a single GPU, set the device ID as `local rank`. This step is not required for usage on CPU.
```python 
device = "xpu:{}".format(args.local_rank)
torch.xpu.set_device(device)
```
* Wrap model by DDP.
```python
model = model.to(device)
model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[device])
```

Note: For single-device modules, `device_ids` can contain exactly one device id, which represents the only GPU device where the input module corresponding to this process resides. Alternatively, device_ids can be `None`.

Note: When using `torch.xpu.optimize` for distributed training with low precision, the `torch.xpu.manual_seed(seed_number)` is needed to make sure the master weight is the same on all ranks.

## Example Usage (MPI launch for single node):

Intel® oneCCL Bindings for Pytorch\* recommends MPI as the launcher to start multiple processes. Here's an example to illustrate such usage.

Dynamic link oneCCL and Intel MPI libraries:

```bash
source $(python -c "import oneccl_bindings_for_pytorch as torch_ccl;print(torch_ccl.cwd)")/env/setvars.sh
# Or
source <ONEAPI_ROOT>/ccl/latest/env/vars.sh
source <ONEAPI_ROOT>/mpi/latest/env/vars.sh
```

`Example_DDP.py`

```python

## DDP scaling API (GPU Only)

For using one GPU card with multiple tiles, each tile could be regarded as a device for explicit scaling. We provide a DDP scaling API to enable DDP on one GPU card in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/blob/xpu-master/intel_extension_for_pytorch/xpu/single_card.py).

### Usage of DDP scaling API 

Note: This API supports GPU devices on one card.

```python
Args:
model: model to be parallelized
train_dataset: dataset for training
```

If you have a model running on a single tile, you only need to make minor changes to enable the DDP training by following these steps:

* Import the API:

```python
try:
    from intel_extension_for_pytorch.xpu.single_card import single_card_dist
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError("single_card_dist not available!")
```

* Use multi_process_spawn launcher as a torch.multiprocessing wrapper.

```python
single_card_dist.multi_process_spawn(main_worker, (args, )) # put arguments of main_worker into a tuple
```

* Usage of this API:

```python
dist = single_card_dist(model, train_dataset)
local_rank, model, train_sampler = dist.rank, dist.model, dist.train_sampler
```

* Set in the model training:

```python
for epoch in range ...
    train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
```

* Adjust the model to call `local_rank`, `model`, and `train_sampler` as shown here:

- device: get the xpu information used in model training

```python
xpu = "xpu:{}".format(local_rank)
print("DDP Use XPU: {} for training".format(xpu))
```

- model: use the model warpped by DDP in the following training

- train_sampler: use the train_sampler to get the train_loader

```python
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=args.batch_size, shuffle=(train_sampler is None),
    num_workers=args.workers, pin_memory=True, sampler=train_sampler)
```
Then you can start your model training on multiple GPU devices of one card.
